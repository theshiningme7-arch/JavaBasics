JAVA EXCEPTIONS & EXCEPTION HANDLING – DETAILED NOTES

---

🔹 WHAT IS AN EXCEPTION?

Definition:
An exception is an event that occurs during program execution that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.  
It usually happens due to errors like invalid input, missing files, or division by zero.

Examples:
- Dividing by zero
- Accessing an invalid array index
- Opening a file that does not exist

---

🔹 EXCEPTION HIERARCHY

Throwable (root class)
   ↳ Error (serious issues, not handled by programs)
   ↳ Exception (can be handled by programs)

Types of Exceptions:
1. Checked Exceptions → Checked at compile time (e.g., IOException, SQLException)
2. Unchecked Exceptions → Occur at runtime (e.g., ArithmeticException, NullPointerException)

---

🔹 WHY EXCEPTION HANDLING?

Purpose:
- Prevent program crash
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Maintain normal flow of program

---

🔹 EXCEPTION HANDLING KEYWORDS

1. try → Block of code that may throw exception
2. catch → Block that handles exception
3. finally → Block that always executes (cleanup code)
4. throw → Used to explicitly throw an exception
5. throws → Declares exceptions that a method may throw

---

🔹 BASIC FLOW

try {
   // risky code
} catch(ExceptionType e) {
   // handling code
} finally {
   // cleanup code
}

---

🔹 EXAMPLES

1. Try-Catch Example
class Test {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      int a = 10, b = 0;
      try {
         int result = a / b;
         System.out.println(result);
      } catch(ArithmeticException e) {
         System.out.println("Error: Division by zero!");
      }
   }
}
// Output: Error: Division by zero!

---

2. Finally Block Example
try {
   System.out.println("Inside try");
} catch(Exception e) {
   System.out.println("Inside catch");
} finally {
   System.out.println("Inside finally");
}
// Output: Inside try
//         Inside finally

---

3. Throw Example
class Test {
   static void checkAge(int age) {
      if(age < 18) {
         throw new ArithmeticException("Not eligible to vote");
      } else {
         System.out.println("Eligible to vote");
      }
   }
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      checkAge(16);
   }
}
// Output: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: Not eligible to vote

---

4. Throws Example
import java.io.*;
class Test {
   void readFile() throws IOException {
      FileReader fr = new FileReader("data.txt");
   }
}

---

🔹 DIFFERENCES SUMMARY

Checked Exception → Compile-time, must be handled  
Unchecked Exception → Runtime, may or may not be handled  
Error → Serious issue, cannot be recovered  

---

🔹 PRACTICE QUESTIONS

1. True/False
- Exceptions are objects in Java → True
- finally block always executes → True
- Errors can be handled using try-catch → False

---

2. Short Answer
Q: What is the difference between throw and throws?
A: throw → used inside method to throw exception  
   throws → used in method signature to declare exceptions

---

3. Predict the Output
try {
   int arr[] = new int[3];
   arr[5] = 10;
} catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
   System.out.println("Invalid index!");
}

Answer → Invalid index!

---

END OF NOTES

Exceptions → Unexpected events during program execution  
Exception Handling → Mechanism to handle them gracefully  

Together, they ensure Java programs are robust and error-resistant.
