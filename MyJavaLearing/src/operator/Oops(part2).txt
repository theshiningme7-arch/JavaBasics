JAVA ADVANCED OOPS – ASSOCIATION & TYPES

---

🔹 WHAT IS ASSOCIATION?

Definition:
Association defines a relationship between two classes.  
It shows how objects of one class are connected to objects of another class.

Purpose:
- Model real-world relationships
- Improve modularity
- Clarify how classes interact

Flowchart:
Class A ↔ Class B → Relationship established

Example:
class Student {
   String name;
}
class Course {
   String title;
}

Here, Student and Course can be associated (a student enrolls in a course).

---

🔹 TYPES OF ASSOCIATION

1. ONE-TO-ONE
Definition:
One object of a class is associated with one object of another class.

Example:
class Passport {
   String number;
}
class Person {
   Passport passport;
}

Flow:
Person → has → Passport

---

2. ONE-TO-MANY
Definition:
One object of a class is associated with many objects of another class.

Example:
class Teacher {
   String name;
}
class School {
   List<Teacher> teachers;
}

Flow:
School → has many → Teachers

---

3. MANY-TO-ONE
Definition:
Many objects of a class are associated with one object of another class.

Example:
class Employee {
   String name;
   Company company;
}
class Company {
   String companyName;
}

Flow:
Employees → belong to → One Company

---

4. MANY-TO-MANY
Definition:
Many objects of one class are associated with many objects of another class.

Example:
class Student {
   List<Course> courses;
}
class Course {
   List<Student> students;
}

Flow:
Students ↔ Courses (multiple associations both ways)

---

🔹 SPECIALIZED ASSOCIATION TYPES

1. AGGREGATION
Definition:
Represents a "HAS-A" relationship.  
Child objects can exist independently of parent.

Example:
class Department {
   String name;
}
class University {
   List<Department> departments;
}

Flow:
University → has → Departments  
Departments can exist without University.

---

2. COMPOSITION
Definition:
Represents a "HAS-A" relationship with strong dependency.  
Child objects cannot exist without parent.

Example:
class Engine {
   String type;
}
class Car {
   Engine engine = new Engine();
}

Flow:
Car → has → Engine  
If Car is destroyed, Engine is destroyed too.

---

🔹 DIFFERENCES SUMMARY

Association → General relationship between classes  
Aggregation → Weak "HAS-A" relationship (independent existence)  
Composition → Strong "HAS-A" relationship (dependent existence)

---

🔹 PRACTICE QUESTIONS

1. True/False
- Aggregation allows independent existence of child objects → True
- Composition means child cannot exist without parent → True
- Association only means classes are related → True

---

2. Short Answer
Q: Which relationship is stronger — Aggregation or Composition?
A: Composition (child depends on parent).

Q: Give an example of One-to-Many association.
A: A School has many Teachers.

3. Predict the Output:
class Engine {
   void start() { System.out.println("Engine started"); }
}
class Car {
   Engine e = new Engine();
   void drive() {
      e.start();
      System.out.println("Car is driving");
   }
}
public class Test {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Car c = new Car();
      c.drive();
   }
}

Answer:
Engine started  
Car is driving

END OF NOTES

Association and its types (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-One, Many-to-Many)  
Aggregation and Composition (weak vs strong HAS-A relationships)  

These advanced OOP concepts help model real-world relationships between classes and objects in Java.
