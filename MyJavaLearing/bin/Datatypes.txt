#  Java Quick Notes

### Why Java Was Created
- Created in 1991 by James Gosling (Sun Microsystems).  
- Problems with C/C++: platform dependent, manual memory management, unsafe for internet, complex.  
- Java solved this with: secure, simple, reliable, platform independent language.  
- Motto: **WORA – Write Once, Run Anywhere**.

---

### Platform Dependent vs Independent
- **Platform = OS + Hardware**  
- C/C++: Source → Machine Code → Runs only on that OS.  
- Java: Source → Bytecode → JVM → Machine Code → Runs anywhere.

---

### Java Execution Process
1. Write code → `file.java`  
2. Compile → `javac file.java` → `file.class` (bytecode)  
3. Run → `java file` → JVM executes bytecode.  

---

### JVM, JRE, JDK
- **JVM**: Runs bytecode.  
- **JRE**: JVM + libraries (to run programs).  
- **JDK**: JRE + compiler + tools (to develop programs).  
- To **develop** → JDK, to **run only** → JRE.

---

### Bytecode
- Intermediate code after compilation.  
- Not machine code, understood by JVM.  
- Reason Java is platform independent.

---

### Compiled or Interpreted?
- Both.  
- Compiled → `javac` → bytecode.  
- Interpreted → JVM executes bytecode.  
- JIT compiler → converts frequent bytecode to native machine code for speed.

---

### Why Java is Secure
- No pointers.  
- Automatic memory management (Garbage Collector).  
- Bytecode verification.  
- Sandboxed execution.

---

### Memory Structure in Java
- **Stack** → method calls + local variables.  
- **Heap** → objects.  

---

### Everything in Java is Inside a Class
- Purely object-oriented (except primitives).  
- No standalone functions.  

---

### Entry Point
```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```
- `main` is static → JVM calls without creating object.

---

### Java Philosophy
- Simplicity over complexity.  
- Automatic memory management.  
- Strong type checking.  
- Object-oriented design.  
- Platform independence.

### Must-Know Before Datatypes
- Why Java was created.  
- JVM, JRE, JDK.  
- Bytecode.  
- Execution process.  
- Platform independence.  
- Stack vs Heap.  
- Why no pointers. 

###Objects
- An object is an instance of a class.
- It represents a real-world entity with state (data/fields) and behavior (methods).
- Example: If Car is a class, then myCar is an object of that class.
- Objects are created using the new keyword, e.g., Car myCar = new Car();

###Classes
- A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.
- It defines the fields (variables) and methods (functions) that its objects will have.

class Car {
    String color;
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}

 ###Methods
- A method is a block of code inside a class that performs a specific task.
- Methods define the behavior of objects.
- They can take parameters, return values, or simply execute logic.
void startEngine() {
    System.out.println("Engine started");
}

###Comments in java
-used to explain Java code
-used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.
-
###Single-line Comments
Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).
### Java Multi-line Comments
/* ....*/=> anything between this will be ignored by java.

###Variables in Java
-syntax: type variableName = value;
-Final Variables- 
- When we don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values, use the final keyword 
-(this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only)
final int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;//error

###Datatypes
Perfect — here’s a **short, simple, and effective table of Java data types** with their classification. 
This is exactly what students need for quick revision.

# Java Data Types 

| **Category**        | **Type**        | **Size** (approx) | **Example**        | **Notes** |
|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Primitive**        | byte            | 1 byte            | `byte b = 10;`     | Small integers (-128 to 127) |
|                      | short           | 2 bytes           | `short s = 1000;`  | Medium integers |
|                      | int             | 4 bytes           | `int x = 50000;`   | Default integer type |
|                      | long            | 8 bytes           | `long l = 100000L;`| Large integers |
|                      | float           | 4 bytes           | `float f = 3.14f;` | Decimal numbers (less precision) |
|                      | double          | 8 bytes           | `double d = 3.14159;` | Decimal numbers (high precision) |
|                      | char            | 2 bytes           | `char c = 'A';`    | Single character (Unicode) |
|                      | boolean         | 1 bit (JVM uses 1 byte) | `boolean flag = true;` | True/False values |
| **Non-Primitive**    | String          | varies            | `String s = "Java";` | Sequence of characters |
|                      | Arrays          | varies            | `int[] arr = {1,2,3};` | Collection of same type |
|                      | Classes         | varies            | `class Student {...}` | User-defined types |
|                      | Interfaces      | varies            | `interface Shape {...}` | Contract for classes |

### Key Points 
- **Primitive types**: 8 fixed, predefined by Java.  
- **Non-primitive types**: Created by programmer (Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interfaces).  
- **Default values**:  
  - int → 0  
  - float → 0.0  
  - boolean → false  
  - object references → null  
- **String** is not primitive, but widely used like one.  
- Interview tip: Always mention **Java has 8 primitive data types**.

# Java Data Types with Ranges

| **Type**   | **Size** | **Range** (approx)                                | **Example** |
|------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **byte**   | 1 byte   | -2^7 to 2^7 - 1 → **-128 to +127**                | `byte b = 10;` |
| **short**  | 2 bytes  | -2^15 to 2^15 - 1 → **-32,768 to +32,767**        | `short s = 1000;` |
| **int**    | 4 bytes  | -2^31 to 2^31 - 1 → **-2.1 × 10^9 to +2.1 × 10^9**| `int x = 50000;` |
| **long**   | 8 bytes  | -2^63 to 2^63 - 1 → **-9.2 × 10^18 to +9.2 × 10^18**| `long l = 100000L;` |
| **float**  | 4 bytes  | ~ ±3.4 × 10^-38 to ±3.4 × 10^38                   | `float f = 3.14f;` |
| **double** | 8 bytes  | ~ ±1.7 × 10^-308 to ±1.7 × 10^308                 | `double d = 3.14159;` |
| **char**   | 2 bytes  | Unicode 0 to 65,535 → **‘\u0000’ to ‘\uFFFF’**    | `char c = 'A';` |
| **boolean**| 1 bit (JVM uses 1 byte) | **true / false**                   | `boolean flag = true;` |

### 🔑 Key Points 
- **8 primitive types** in Java: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.  
- **Ranges** are based on powers of 2 (easy to remember).  
- **Default values**:  
  - int → 0  
  - float/double → 0.0  
  - boolean → false  
  - char → `'\u0000'`  
  - object references → null  
- **String, Arrays, Classes, Interfaces** → Non-primitive types.
